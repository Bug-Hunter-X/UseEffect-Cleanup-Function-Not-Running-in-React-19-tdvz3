# React 19 useEffect Cleanup Function Not Running

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in React 19 where the cleanup function within a `useEffect` hook does not always run as expected. This issue arises under specific circumstances, particularly when rapid re-renders occur within a parent component.

## Bug Description
The cleanup function in a `useEffect` hook is designed to perform necessary actions when a component unmounts or before the next effect runs. In this scenario, the cleanup function fails to execute consistently, leading to potential memory leaks or unexpected behavior. This problem is not readily apparent in typical `useEffect` usage.  The bug is subtle and appears primarily when interacting with complex state management techniques or when a parent component triggers frequent and rapid re-renders.  

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the console output to see the erratic behavior of the cleanup function.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring correct dependency handling within the `useEffect` hook and potentially optimizing the re-rendering process of the parent component if it's causing excessive updates.
